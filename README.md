## Moviepilot CLI

It's really up to you what you would like to do. One example could be the trending view or a search interface. Here are some api endpoints to get you going:

- http://api.moviepilot.com/v4/trending
- http://api.moviepilot.com/v3/search?q=marvel
- http://api.moviepilot.com/v4/posts/3344982

What you build is up to you, do something that a) you enjoy doing (this should be fun!) and b) you think can show some of your strengths. It's also up to you how much time you want to spend with this.
